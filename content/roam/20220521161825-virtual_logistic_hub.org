* Graph representation
** rich semantic of nodes and edges
*** nodes: vehicles; clients
**** attributes: coordinates, loading, capacity,
*** edges:
**** tasks (connecting vehicles and clients), multiple
**** connectivity
***** road network
***** realtime traffic
*** parcel transaction induces local neighborhood changes
*** network evolves over time
*** node level (graphlet feature vector, local agent-client connection)
** bipartite graph
** alignment of two separation graphs
** business goals
*** optimization of client satisfaction
*** engery savings of fleets
*** optimal utilization of fleets
*** vehicle dispatching response
*** optimal operation of the whole network
** solution (prediction)
*** node-level
*** link-level
*** graph-level
