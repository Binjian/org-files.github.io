#+title: VAE

* Way of VAE
** maximum likelihood of the data distribution, with latent space of a minimal prior information
*** KL-divergence is indirect
* property
** prioar $p(z)$ has an impact, Gaussiana as prior has the maximal entropy and thus minimizaion of the prior information.
** $p_{\theta}(z|x)$ and $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ will be finally very simimlar thus can be ignored.
** encoder part use KL-Divergence, Decoder data maximum likelihood
