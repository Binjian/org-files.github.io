#+title: battery aging model
* battery capacity estimation
** State of Health (SoH)
+ ratio of relative residual capacity with respect to the initial capacity
+ critical for range prediction and maximum energy storage capability
+ battery capacity: full charge process, parking iwt grid connection
+ discharge is uncertain with environmental and operational conditions,
  + discharge curve is seldom available for on-board SoH monitoring
  + charging and discharging voltage depends on thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the batttery
+ do not need to a deep understanding of the electrochemical model, but large datasets
+ degradation features?
+ charging
  + regularly
  + favorable
  + relaxation process has a relationship with SoH:
    + relaxation voltage value at a specific time
    + the voltage curve during a specific period
  + CC (constant current) charge voltage-based
  + CC-CV (constant current-constant voltage) charge voltage-based
  + *charging strategy for the purpose of surveying SoH?*
  + *What is the general capacity degrading udner temperautre and charging current, cycles*?
  + multistage charging? optimal stategy relying on real SoC
  + start of charge normally distributed
  + partial charge process in a specific voltage range for feature extraction
    + SOTA RMSE 0.39% ~ 4.26%
  + differential voltage analysis, incremental capacity analysis for battery aging mechanism identification and capacity fade evaluation
    + SVR (support vector regression), GPPF (Gaussian Process Particle Filter), BPNN (Back-Propagation Neural Network), linear model
    + partial incremental capacity curve
  + rest voltage-based are few
    + linear model utilizing resting process: voltage after 30 min rest when fully charged: capacity estimation percentage error 0.7%~3.3%
    + method using voltage relaxation for lithium plating detection
    + ECM (Equivalent Circuit Model) to describe the voltage relaxation
    + RC (resistor-capacitor) network model: batttery capacity decay during rest periods at 100% SoC using a dynamic time constant from RC model
+ results with features from voltage relaxation curve:
  + ElasticNet, XGBoost, SVR: RMSE 1.0%, 1.7%, 1.6%
  + Battery: NCA, NCM, NCM+NCA
+ discharging
  + random
  + driving behaviors
  + road environments
